# Specification Quality Checklist: F-0002 — Propietarios (Sujetos Fiscales)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-07  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Note on `deleted_by`**: The spec (FR-014, FR-019) requires recording and exposing `deleted_by`. In the current single-user context (F-0001), the authenticated operator's identity is captured as `deleted_by`. This field must be revisited and validated for correctness when multi-user support is introduced.
